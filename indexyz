<h1>DEAR CHIKKY 🌙</h1>

    <p>
        I’ve been trying to find the right words all day, but they all feel a bit too small for how I actually feel about you.
        Whenever I think of "us," my mind always races back to that farewell day.
        Seeing you in that blue and white langavoni… it wasn’t just that you looked beautiful — you were breathtaking.
        It was the moment I realized I never wanted to look at anyone else.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’m still captivated by that girl, and I think I always will be.
        What hits me the hardest, Chikky, is how you’ve stayed so purely you.
        In a world that’s always trying to change people, you’ve remained the same soul I fell for on day one.
        Your heart hasn’t shifted an inch, and having that kind of “constant” in my life is the greatest gift I’ve ever received.
    </p>

    <p>
        It’s the quiet moments that mean the most to me now — like the way you feed me.
        It’s such a simple, tender act, but it makes me feel safe and truly seen.
        And I know I tease you, but I genuinely adore everything about you,
        right down to your nose.
        It’s perfect because it’s yours,
        and it’s part of the face that represents “home” to me.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you for being my beautiful memory and my even better reality.
        I love you more than these words can even begin to show.
        I don’t just want you in my memories of the past;
        I want you in every single one of my memories in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
        I love your smile.  
        I love your heart.  
        And I love that cute nose of yours more than I can say.
    </p>
